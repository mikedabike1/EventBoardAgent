name: Migrate Production Database

# Runs Alembic migrations against the Neon production (main) branch when
# code is merged to main.  Migrations run before the app restarts on Render,
# so the schema is always up to date before new code goes live.
#
# Required repository secret:
#   NEON_PROD_DATABASE_URL — set automatically by the infra.yml workflow,
#                            or manually after running `terraform output prod_database_url`.
