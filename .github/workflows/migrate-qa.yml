name: Migrate QA Database

# Runs Alembic migrations against the Neon QA branch whenever a non-main
# branch is pushed.  This keeps the QA schema in sync with the latest
# migration on any active development branch.
#
# Required repository secret:
#   NEON_QA_DATABASE_URL — set automatically by the infra.yml workflow,
#                          or manually after running `terraform output qa_database_url`.
